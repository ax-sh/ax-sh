    I am a UI/UX Designer & Full Stack Developer (mostly in Python & JavaScript). 
    I've got experience with Python & React, and have also worked on a couple of Flask, Express projects.
    I like to work on interesting computer projects all the time, and have also created a few other projects on my github.

    I try to design my work based on the aesthetics, usability and simplicity.

    I am available for hire. I've got experience with frameworks like React, TailwindCSS, Flask and few others that I enjoy. 
    If you've got a project in mind, feel free to contact me via email (at the bottom).
